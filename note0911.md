#### Example 2
# another way to count C in a DNA string

DNA='AATGCTTA'
type(DNA)
number_of_Cs=DNA.count('C')
number_of_Cs


#### Example 3 Booleans
```
    1 < 2 # false
    2 <= 1 #false
    'a' == 'apple' #false
    'a' != 'apple' #don't work
    '1' < 2.345 # false
    'abraham' < 'isaac'  # true
    True == False #don't work
    true == FALSE #don't work
    (1<2) == ('pies' == 'squared') #false
